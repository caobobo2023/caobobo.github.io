I am a PhD graduate in Robotics from Zhejiang University. Currently, I am working at SenseTime Co, where I specialize in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

During my time at Zhejiang University, I immersed myself in the study of robotics, focusing on the robotic systems. My doctoral research provided me with a solid foundation in advanced algorithms and control strategies for motion planning in dynamic environments. 

At SenseTime Co, I am fortunate to be part of a talented team that shares a common vision of shaping the future of transportation. As a motion planning & control specialist, my role involves designing and implementing algorithms that enable autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently. 

Aside from my professional pursuits, I am a sports enthusiast. Badminton has been a favorite sport of mine for many years, and I enjoy playing it during my leisure time. Sports not only help me maintain a healthy lifestyle but also foster teamwork, discipline, and a competitive spiritâ€”all of which are qualities that translate well into my work.
